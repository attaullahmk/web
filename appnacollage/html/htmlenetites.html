    an html entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand
    (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). use to display reserved character (wich
    woul otherwise be interperted as HTML code,) and invisible character (like
    non-breaking space). can also use in place of character that are difficult
    to type with a standard keyboard. browser interprets them and renders
    correct character..‚ù§ü§£
